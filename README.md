# Material Grey *[Mailspring]*

Material Grey is a theme built for Mailspring mail client from the starter official template [here](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter). This project is inspired by Google's Material design - darker shades of [blue-grey](https://material.io/tools/color/). Goes pretty much well with the system-wide theme on **Gnome**, linked [here](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Lavender-theme).
